![Picture showing the website on launch.](ressources\pp-screenshot.png)

## About the Project
This is a small and customizable pomodoro timer that you can integrate into OBS Studio. Feel free to use it in your next learn-with-me stream!

## How to use the timer
### With OBS Studio
1. Under "Sources", click on "+" to add a new source. Select "Browser" and "Create new". 
1. On https://muederotter.github.io/petitepomodoro, configure your setup and click on the link to copy it.
1. Paste it into the URL input in OBS Studio. I prefer to change the width to 300 and the height to 200. Now press "Ok".
1. To start the timer, right-click onto the Browser Source and select "Interact". A new window should pop up and by clicking on the timer you should start a 10 second countdown. After those 10 seconds, your timer starts.
